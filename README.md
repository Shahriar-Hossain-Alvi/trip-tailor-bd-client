# About: Trip-Tailor-BD is a tour guide agency that offers different types of packages and provides well-detailed lists of their tour guides. The platform includes features where users or tourists can add their travel stories, write reviews about the tour guides, and share their experiences on social media platforms. Users can view and cancel their booked packages, add packages to their wishlists, and remove them as needed. Additionally, there is an option to send a request to the admin to become a tour guide.
